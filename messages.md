# CHAT: update the readme to say that this is currently a project based on ... [2024-09-23T19:53:08+02:00]
update the readme to say that this is currently a project based on aichat to incorperate specialized agents in the daily drive for a regular arch user. future projects spawned by this will probably be a dotfile manager and a todo manager . the first phase will probably be to create scripts and a framework to enable the agents to manage most parts of text based configuration

Here's an updated version of your README:

# Project Overview

This project is currently based on **AIChat** and aims to incorporate specialized agents into the daily workflow of a regular Arch Linux user. The focus is to facilitate day-to-day tasks through intelligent agents that can manage various aspects of a user's system and interface.

## Future Projects

The current work on this project will likely lead to the development of additional tools:
1. **Dotfile Manager**: A specialized manager for handling and organizing dotfiles.
2. **ToDo Manager**: A task manager to help users organize and keep track of their to-dos.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Script and Framework Development

The first phase involves creating scripts and a robust framework. This will enable the agents to manage most parts of text-based configuration, ensuring a more seamless and efficient user experience.

# Project Overview

This project is currently based on **AIChat** and aims to incorporate specialized agents into the daily workflow of a regular Arch Linux user. The focus is to facilitate day-to-day tasks through intelligent agents that can manage various aspects of a user's system and interface.

## Introduction
**AIChat** is an intelligent chat-based interface that allows users to interact with their system using natural language. This project leverages AIChat to create specialized agents designed to simplify and automate routine tasks for Arch Linux users.

## Future Projects

The current work on this project will likely lead to the development of additional tools:
1. **Dotfile Manager**: A specialized manager for handling and organizing dotfiles.
2. **ToDo Manager**: A task manager to help users organize and keep track of their to-dos.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Script and Framework Development

The first phase involves creating scripts and a robust framework. This will enable the agents to manage most parts of text-based configuration, ensuring a more seamless and efficient user experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites
- Arch Linux installed on your system
- Python 3.x installed
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

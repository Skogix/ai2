# Project Overview

This project is currently based on **AIChat** and aims to incorporate specialized agents into the daily workflow of a regular Arch Linux user. The focus is to facilitate day-to-day tasks through intelligent agents that can manage various aspects of a user's system and interface.

## Future Projects

The current work on this project will likely lead to the development of additional tools:
1. **Dotfile Manager**: A specialized manager for handling and organizing dotfiles.
2. **ToDo Manager**: A task manager to help users organize and keep track of their to-dos.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Script and Framework Development

The first phase involves creating scripts and a robust framework. This will enable the agents to manage most parts of text-based configuration, ensuring a more seamless and efficient user experience.

## Changelog
### 0.1
- Initial project setup.
